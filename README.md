# CrazyEggs
CrazyEggs is a Spigot Plugin that provides killer eggs!

There are 2 primary eggs:
Crazy Egg and Destruction Egg

Crazy Egg provides a good way to kill an entity without causing much chaos. The fallen entity may drop its spawn egg!
Destruction Egg, on the other hand, is an even more efficient way to kill, but causes much more chaos due to the aggressive explosions!
